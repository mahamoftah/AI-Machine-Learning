## **Digital Twin Graph Predictions**

- Digital twins, virtual representations of physical assets, offer a
powerful tool for monitoring, predicting, and optimizing
performance. This project proposes a novel approach for digital
twin time series forecasting using interpretable Graph Neural
Network (GNN) models. Our solution will leverage the spatial
relationships between devices within a network to enhance
forecasting accuracy and provide insights into how devices
influence each other's behavior.

- Traditional time series forecasting methods often neglect the
spatial relationships between data points. GNNs offer a unique
advantage by modeling these relationships, capturing how devices
within a network interact and influence each other's behavior.

- **Project Objectives**
  - Develop interpretable GNN-based time series forecasting models for digital twins.
  - Utilize spatial information of IoT devices within the network to improve forecast accuracy.
  - Incorporate interpretable machine learning techniques to explain model predictions and build trust with users.
  - Design effective visualizations to showcase the impact of different devices on individual forecasts.
